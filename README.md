# Nexus Services - Roblox API Platform

**Nexus Services** is a comprehensive Roblox API solution designed to streamline the process of fetching player inventory data for game developers. Created by **Zap** and powered by **Zauataun**, this service provides robust endpoints that make it simple to retrieve detailed information about any Roblox player's assets.

## What It Does

Nexus Services specializes in pulling three key categories of player data:

**Gamepasses** - Fetch all gamepasses owned or created by a specific player, making it easy to display their available passes for purchase or donation.

**Clothing Items** - Access a player's entire wardrobe, including T-Shirts, Shirts, and Pants. This allows developers to showcase clothing items that players are selling or want to promote.

**UGC Items** - Retrieve User-Generated Content (accessories, hats, gear, and other catalog items) that players own, enabling comprehensive inventory displays.

## Primary Use Case: PLS DONATE-Style Games

The most popular application for Nexus Services is building **PLS DONATE-style games**. These are Roblox experiences where players can set up stands or booths to display their gamepasses, clothing, and UGC items for others to purchase, effectively allowing the community to support each other through in-game donations. 

By integrating Nexus Services' API into your game, you can:
- Automatically fetch and display a player's sellable items
- Create dynamic storefronts that update in real-time
- Build donation booths without manually tracking inventory
- Enhance user experience with seamless data synchronization

## Technical Benefits

The API handles all the heavy lifting of Roblox's data retrieval, providing clean, organized responses that developers can immediately implement into their games. This eliminates the need to build custom web scrapers or navigate Roblox's native API limitations, saving significant development time and reducing potential errors.

## Getting Started & Support

Whether you're building your first donation game or looking to enhance an existing project, **Zap** is available to help. For integration assistance, API documentation, technical support, or general inquiries about Nexus Services, reach out directly on Discord: **@zap_loll**
